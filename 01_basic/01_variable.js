const accountId = 1444
let accountEmail = "yashraj@gmail.com"
var accountPassword = "bengaluru"

// accountCity = "bihar"

// accountId = 14 this will throw an error because accountId is a constant sp this is not allowed

accountEmail = "jajsk@gmai.com"
accountPassword = "delhi"
// accountCity = "mumbai"

/* prefer not to use var becoz of issue of block scope and functional scope  */


// console.table([accountEmail, accountPassword, accountId]) this will print the values in a table format
